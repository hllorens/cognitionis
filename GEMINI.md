This is a simple website, so keep it as simple as possible.

Since the content is stored in data.json you need a basic web server to test the website locally (python3 -m http.server 8000).

Before doing any change make sure the files are commited so that changes can be reverted easily.

When you are asked to add new content, you should edit the `data.json` file and add a new entry to the corresponding category. If the category does not exist, you should create it.
